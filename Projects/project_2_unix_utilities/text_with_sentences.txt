C is a general-purpose
procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming
lexical variable scope
and recursion
with a static type system
By design
C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions
It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language
C is an imperative procedural language
It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions
all with minimal runtime support
Despite its low-level capabilities
the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming
